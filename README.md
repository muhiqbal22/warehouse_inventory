## Features
- **Search Bar**

- **Customizable data entries**  
  Add and edit items at any time. Fill in as much information as necessary such as name, price, quantity and even a product description. Add relevant tags to your products as you see fit. 
- **Data sorting**  
  Use the sort button to change how you want to view your database. Sort items alphabetically or by their order of addition into the database.
- **Database storage**  
  With the help of SQLite3 database, you can add, delete and edit any number of items and keep them saved securely on your device. Additional safety checks provided allow you to confirm before changing or permanently deleting anything from your database.
- **Material Design**  
  Material Design allows manipulating database to be more intuitive than ever. Everything from the colour scheme to iconography enhances the user's experience and allows for changes to be quick and easy. Updating your database doesn't have to be intimidating.
